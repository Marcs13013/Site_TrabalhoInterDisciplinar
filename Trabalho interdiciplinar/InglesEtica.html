    <p class="titulo2"> John Sculley and his famous phrases </p>
    <p class="introducao4"> John Sculley, known for being the former CEO of Apple Inc. <br> during the 1980s, is not as
        well-known for famous quotes as some other business leaders. <br><br> However, here are some attributed quotes:
        <br> <br>
        "People don't know what they want until we show it to them." <br>
        This is a famous phrase that Sculley used to express the idea that consumers often cannot anticipate their needs
        and desires until a new and exciting technology or product is presented to them. <br><br>
        "The future belongs to those who are willing to shape it." <br>
        This phrase emphasizes the idea that innovation and future success are in the hands of those who are willing to

        "Marketing is really about sharing values." <br>
        Sculley spoke about the importance of companies connecting with customers through the identification and
        promotion of shared values. <br><br>
        Sculley remained at Apple until 1993, overseeing significant business expansion but also facing challenges,
        including intense competition in the personal computer market. <br> His time at Apple was marked by strategic
        decisions and innovations but also by criticism related to management and the company's direction. <br><br>

    <p class="titulo1"> Ética de John Sculley no Ambiente de Trabalho </p>

    <p class="introducao4"> Em termos de ética, Sculley é lembrado por ter adotado ações questionáveis dentro da
        empresa,
        como o aumento dos preços dos produtos sem trazer grandes inovações, além de ter afastado Steve Jobs da empresa
        em um
        período crucial. <br>
        Muitos críticos apontam que suas decisões visavam mais os resultados financeiros do que a
        preservação da visão inovadora da Apple. <br><br>

        No geral, Sculley foi um CEO que enfrentou desafios complexos e contribuiu para o crescimento da Apple em alguns
        aspectos, porém, sua gestão também é lembrada por questionamentos éticos e estratégias controversas que moldaram
        o curso da empresa. </p>
